<h1>Zeke Marffy's really nice site</h1>

<h2>Who Am I</h2>

<p>I am Zeke Marffy, or that's the name I use for a lot of things, anyway. My actual name is Joe. You may know me from the recurring <a href="http://facebook.com/MarauderGold">Marauder Gold meme/joke</a> at Millersville University. I received a BS in Computer Science there in 2018. I love everything technology, but I specialize in the software aspect of things. I also hack together musical creations in really janky ways.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>My main interests include very specific aspects of games (the inner workings of the first generation Pok√©mon games) as well as a very select few games in their entirety (mostly Call of Duty: Black Ops III), jailbreaking iOS, automating tasks (saying I love programming is an understatement!), and music. I also bike a lot but I know nothing about it.</p>

<p>What kinds of music, you ask? I listen to almost anything but recently I've been very into Poppy and From Ashes To New. I attend every concert that time and location permits if it's a band I know of that has at least a few heavy songs. Even if I don't listen to them, I will still go to their concerts.</p>

<p>I mess around with graphic design sometimes, too, but I don't know the right way to do things. Just like music.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>I've done quite a bit of interesting things in my lifetime I'm proud of, including "breaking" apps such as Yik Yak, FADE: Nothing Lasts Forever, Unseen, Glow Hockey 2, and AirCoaster, to name just a few. You can read more about such on my Tumblr I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>I have experience with Java, C++, Python, BASH, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Python is by far my language of choice. I love webscraping and automation. Some simple abanonded personal projects include a meal and Flex dollars checker for Millersville University, a Call of Duty: WWII and Black Ops 3 stats API, and a now-playing on SiriusXM to Spotify playlist. Some current projects include... hey, you're on GitHub. You can check. :P I do have a secret project that automates a program I will not disclose at the moment though. With this secret project came an unofficial API I wrote for the site at hand.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>I have plenty of emails. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:zmarffy@yahoo.com">zmarffy@yahoo.com</a> If you know me well though, don't use that one.</p>
